## My process

### Built with

- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Parcel](https://parceljs.org/) - Module bundler
- [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/) - For styles
- Context API in React
- Flexbox & CSS Grid - For layout
- [react-beautiful-dnd](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-beautiful-dnd) - For adding drag and drop functionality

### What I learned

1. I learnt to use a module bundler like parcel and how to customise it.
2. I learnt how to do theming with styled components and Context API
3. I learnt how to use media queries to check for the current preferred theme on the user's device and show the theme accordingly.
### Continued development

Plan on maybe making this into a PWA and adding some backend and support for notifications but not too serious about it.

### Useful resources

- [React-beautiful-dnd course](https://egghead.io/courses/beautiful-and-accessible-drag-and-drop-with-react-beautiful-dnd) - This course is from the creator of the awesome package called react-beautiful-dnd which helped me understand the working of react-beautiful-dnd.
